Every day, it takes me about 30 minutes to drive to work. During each commute, I listen to radio programs, music, or some audiobooks.

One day, the app I had been using for a long time was taken down due to the misuse of personal privacy information. I began to think, "Why not create my own app?"

Since then, this idea has taken root and sprouted in my mind. Subsequently, I started searching for apps with similar functionality that respect personal privacy. I found that there were hardly any on the market, or they came with various restrictions. However, I wanted a simple and user-friendly tool for reading and listening to books, supporting the efficient organization of a large number of local files, and capable of quickly reviewing books, PDFs, papers, blogs, news, and more. So, like an eager engineer, I embarked on this journey.

Another driving force behind creating this alternative to the unspeakable app was to give back to the open-source community that has benefited me tremendously over the years.

I am proud to share this work with you, an application that values privacy and achieves the joy of reading or listening to books while driving through an easy-to-use and friendly interface.

If you enjoy this application or find it helpful in some way, please consider supporting this project. Your support will help me continue to develop and maintain this app.
