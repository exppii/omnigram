## Dependencies

Please refer to [environment requirements](../install/requirements) for details.

## Docker Startup

By default, after docker starts up it will create a default admin account `admin` with the default password `123456`.

- The default user and password. You can change it after logging in later, or by setting the `OMNI_USER`  `OMNI_PASSWORD` environment variable.
- `${my_local_docs_path}` should be modified to your actual directory path that stores Epubs and PDFs. After logging in, you can configure scanning strategies to build file indices.
- If you need persistent running, please refer to [Best Practices for Deployment](../install/best_practice).

```bash
# Replace my_local_docs_path below with your actual documents directory
docker run -v ${my_local_docs_path}:/docs -p 8080:80 lxpio/omnigram-server:latest
